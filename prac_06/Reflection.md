# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started updating my practical files one by one instead of updating all my files at once. This approach has helped me record better what I did and track my progress more accurately. This change allows for a more organized and manageable workflow, which improves the quality of my documentation and reduces errors.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

One area that still requires improvement is my time management regarding task completion. I need to focus on finishing my tasks earlier, which will provide additional time to review and refine my work. This adjustment will help alleviate stress and enhance the quality of my submissions.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I believe I am performing well in managing online tests and submitting practicals and assignments on time. My ability to adhere to deadlines and efficiently handle assessments has been a strong point that I plan to continue.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

A significant change I need to make is to increase my revision after each lecture. Currently, I do not consistently review lecture material, which can lead to gaps in understanding. Implementing regular review sessions will ensure a deeper understanding and retention of course content, aiding in better overall performance.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

As of now, I have no specific requests or changes to suggest for the subject or the IT degree program. I find the current setup and resources adequately supportive and well-aligned with my educational needs.
