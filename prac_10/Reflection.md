# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial estimations were inaccurate; I frequently underestimated the amount of time required, 
particularly for testing and debugging. I thought everything would be easier than it actually was, but that wasn't always the case.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I began to gain a better understanding of how long things would truly take during the course. By the conclusion of the semester, 
my estimates were far more accurate since I had learnt to account for additional time for unforeseen problems and for improving my code.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt from estimating how important it is to take into account a project's whole scope, including the less evident duties like documentation and code reviews. 
It's an essential ability for efficient time management and realistic deadline setting.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It was enlightening to receive code reviews. It made it easier for me to recognise my knowledge gaps and comprehend various approaches to issues. 
Both the functionality of my code and my coding style were greatly enhanced by the feedback.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I became more knowledgeable about alternate solutions and recommended practices after reviewing other people's code. 
Additionally, it improved my communication skills by teaching me how to provide constructive criticism that is encouraging rather than judgemental.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation


This review pointed up a few possible problems and provided fixes. 
The practical benefited from my thorough input, which clarified the revisions' justification and implementation options.

### Good Code Review 2

Only one student mentions me to do the code review from the Practical 5 - Practical 9


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would encourage cooperation and shared learning by implementing more joint initiatives. 
Working in groups, in my opinion, enhances problem-solving abilities and aids in understanding various coding styles.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I believe I did a great job using the ideas I had learnt in class to address real-world issues. 
I also became much better at debugging complicated problems, which was essential to finishing the tasks quickly.
